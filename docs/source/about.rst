Introduction
============

Have you ever had a lot of ESTs from multiple species and wanted to find the orthologous from one specie to another? You spent a lot of time and wasted efforts? Then this is your package!

An *EST* is an expresed sequence tag. Someone found this sequence in a cDNA, and it's probably a chop of an expresed gene. They can be translated into aminoacids, and they can be used to search another genomes for orthologous sequences. Knowing that, this module would aid you to make your EST library, blast it against another genome and get the best mutual hit for each sequence.
